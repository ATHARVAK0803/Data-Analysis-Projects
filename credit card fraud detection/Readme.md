## Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project is about identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. Credit card fraud happens when someone makes a transaction without the card owner’s permission, and detecting it early is very important for banks and customers.

In this project, a credit card transaction dataset is used. The data is imbalanced, which means fraud cases are very few compared to normal transactions. To solve this problem, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) is used to increase fraud samples and balance the data.

The project follows simple steps:

Load and explore the dataset

Clean and prepare the data

Apply SMOTE to handle imbalanced data

Train a machine learning model

Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

This project is suitable for beginners who want to understand how machine learning can be used in real-life problems like fraud detection. It helps in learning data preprocessing, handling imbalanced datasets, and building basic classification models.
